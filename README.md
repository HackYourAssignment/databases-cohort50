# Module #6 - Databases: Store and retrieve data with MySQL (Backend)

![Databases](./assets/databases.png)

Have you ever thought about how your brain remembers things? It happens automatically for humans, but that's not so for computers. Any time you go to a website and you fill in some details, in for example a form, that `information` needs to be saved somewhere. This "somewhere" is called a `database`.

In this module you'll learn all about a fundamental part of any software application: how to (safely) store data, so that it can be used on-demand. You'll learn how to structure and group data so your apps know where to find and store the correct data.

## Learning goals

In this module you will get familiar with the complexity of storing data. By the end of it you have learned:

-   What the meaning is of a `database entity`
-   How to work with `Structured Query Language` (SQL)
-   Learn all about the `relational model`
-   Recognize the `basic setup of a database`
-   Know about `MySQL` as an example of a relational database system
-   Learn about `NoSQL` databases, with an emphasis on `MongoDB`

## How to use this repository

This repository consists of 3 essential parts:

1. `README`: this document contains all the required theory you need to understand **before** class. It's also meant as a reference to understand what you're doing while you're coding.
2. `MAKEME`: this document contains the instructions for each week's homework.
3. `LESSONPLAN`: this document is meant for teachers as a reference. However, as a student don't be shy to take a look at it as well!

**Before** the first class of the module you should start off with the [Week 1 Reading](/Week1/README.md). Study all the concepts and try to get the gist of everything. After your first class, you can get started with the [Week 1 Homework](/Week1/MAKEME.md).

If you have any questions or if something is not entirely clear ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯, please ask/comment on Slack!

## Before you start

**Before** your first class you start you need to install the necessary software: MySQL. This differs depending on your operating system:

-   For Windows, download the [MySQL Community Server](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/)
-   For Linux (Ubuntu), watch the following video: [MySQL Installation on Linux (Ubuntu)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_LibBhOGOY)
-   For MacOS, watch the following video: [Installing MySQL on MacOS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxCXyxFEA0s)

Afterwards, read the following [document](./setup-db.md) to learn how to setup your database **before** your first class.
