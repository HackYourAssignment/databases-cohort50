## Week goals

This week we want to introduce you to the world of databases! We will start with a general introduction to what databases are, going over some terms and how to start thinking about your application's data. Have a look for the introduction [here](https://hackyourfuture.github.io/study/#/databases/README).

In this module we will be covering both the relational type of databases (SQL) as well as document based databases (NoSQL). For now you do not need to know the difference, that will become apparent when we have covered both. We will start by going into relational database by learning about SQL, which is the language used when interacting with most relational databases. Have a look [here](https://hackyourfuture.github.io/study/#/databases/sql/README).

Lastly, let's go over some practical information that will allow you to save your databases and share it with others! Learn all about database dumps [here](https://hackyourfuture.github.io/study/#/databases/sql/dumps)
