# Lesson Plan Databases Week 3

The lesson plan is primarily written for teachers so that they can
use examples and anecdotes from this document in conjunction with the README
and explain the concepts better in the class.

##  Topics (essentially same as the README file)
1. Normalization and normal forms
2. Transactions
3. SQL injection
4. NoSQL (with MongoDB) - How to do CRUD operations
5. Non-relational vs. relational


## 1. Normalization and normal forms

### Explanation
Goal of normalization is to reduce duplication. This is done for 2 purposes:  
* Reducing the amount of storage needed to store the data.
* Avoiding unnecessary data conflicts that may creep in because of multiple copies of the same data getting stored.
Different levels of normalization called normal forms. Go over the first and second normal forms. Do not ask students to memorize this, try to make them understand instead.
### Example
See examples from `readme`

### Exercise

Students should split in groups and discuss how to normalize the table ![table](https://www.guru99.com/images/NormalizationTable1.png)
