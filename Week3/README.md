# Reading Material Databases Week 3

## Agenda

These are the topics for week 3:

1. [Normalization](https://hackyourfuture.github.io/study/#/databases/sql/normalization)
2. [Transactions](https://hackyourfuture.github.io/study/#/databases/sql/transactions)
3. [SQL injection](https://hackyourfuture.github.io/study/#/databases/sql/sql-injection)

## Week goals

This week we are looking at finalising our SQL knowledge with even more advanced topics. Let's first look at [Normalization](https://hackyourfuture.github.io/study/#/databases/sql/normalization) which is a technique you should be using to design your databases!

Next we are going to look at [Transactions](https://hackyourfuture.github.io/study/#/databases/sql/transactions) which are ways to ensure your data stays clean. Sometimes certain updates need to either all happen or none happen and transactions allow you to do that.

Finally, we will look into the topic of [SQL injection](https://hackyourfuture.github.io/study/#/databases/sql/sql-injection) which you as a backend engineer should be wary about. Not handling this could make it possible for others to delete your whole database!
