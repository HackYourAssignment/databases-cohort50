As a preparation step for the upcoming Q&A, you need to work on the following exercise, which is based on the prep exercise of the previous week. 

### Exercise

Last week you created an ERD for the database for storing food recipes.
How can you normalize your database based on what you learned this week?

* Was your database already in 2NF / 3 NF ?
* What changes did you have to do to normalize your database ?
* If you want to add thousands of recipes to your database, what challenges do you foresee ?
* After learning the basics of NoSQL, how would you convert(migrate) your database into MongoDB ?
* If you were given MySQL and MongoDB as choices to build the recipe's database at the beginning, 
which one would you choose and Why ?
